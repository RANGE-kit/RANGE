# RANGE

RANGE: a Robust Adaptive Nature-inspired Global Explorer of potential energy surfaces

A python code using hybrid ABC+GA algorithm to explore potential energy surfaces and search low-energy structures for chemistry and materials science. It can use a third-party computational software as the energy evaluator.

Publication: TBD
